            <h1>Where Are all the Kindles?</h1>
            <p>I love my E-readers. I use both Kindle and Kobo but the Kindle is by far my favorite. </p>
            <p>I have the 2018 Paperwhite and in the last few months, it’s become so slow and started re-booting at
                random. Ive been putting off an upgrade as I don’t like how big the newest generation Paperwhite is and
                the basic is missing some features.</p>
            <p>I’ve done a lot of research in the past few weeks and eventually decided I need nothing more than the
                basic. I own an oasis which never leaves the house, so the basic would be ideal to throw in my bag and
                take when traveling, etc.</p>
            <p>Ive searched everywhere and there are no kindles in stock! </p>
            <p>So what is going on? A month ago they were all in stock on amazon and at our local electrical good store.
                The Kindle Scribe is the only one available, but at 10.2 inches and at a steep price, it’s just not for
                me.</p>
            <p>There is speculation of two new kindles being released before the end of this year and in an article from
                <a href="https://goodereader.com/blog/kindle/amazon-kindle-2022-model-out-of-stock-everywhere"
                    target="_blank">Good
                    e-Reader</a> amazon have attained FCC certification for those.
            </p>

                alt="screenshot description of the meaning of FCC certification">
            <p>There are also rumours of a color kindle Paperwhite being released, so could this be the reason for the
                current lack of stock?</p>
            <p>Personally, I’m not convinced, there is obviously still a market for the 2022 kindle basic and the 2021
                kindle Paperwhite, so why would amazon lose out on money intentionally? </p>
            <p>They discontinued the Kindle Oasis earlier this year, so are they doing the same with the current models
                ahead of the next release? </p>
            <p>Only time will tell.</p>
